A (testing) set of base code for creating HTML5 Responsive Drupal 7 themes.

It is absolutely minimal in my opinion. The only conventioned "baked in" are
the use of LESS CSS and the "mobile first" principle.

Some template.php customizations are included, but are not necessary.

Included libraries:

- breakpoints.js (Customized version)
- fastclick
- html5shiv
- jquery-1.9.1
- modernizr
- respond.js
- selectivizr

Included tools that simply add features

- jquery-ui-1.10.4, themeless (Not necessary, provides a few great tools)
- fitvids (auto-size video embeds)
- flexslider (Not necessary, provides a great responsive Carousel)
- jquery.sticky.js (For floating objects. TODO: Replace with something better)
